`Jon Guyer`_ 
    is a member of the research staff of the `Metallurgy Division`_ in
    |MSEL| at |NIST|.  Jon's computational interests are in object-oriented
    design and in phase field modeling of electrochemistry.

`Daniel Wheeler`_ 
    is a caveman.  Daniel's interests are in numerical modeling, finite
    volume techniques, and level set treatments.

`Jim Warren`_
    is the group leader of the Themodynamics and Kinetics group in the
    `Metallurgy Division`_ and Director of |CTCMS| of |MSEL| at
    |NIST|. Jim is interested in a variety of problems, including the
    phase field modeling of solidification, polycrystalline solids,
    and the electrochemical interface.

Alex Mont
    developed the `PyxViewer` and the `Gmsh` import and export modules while 
    he was a student at `Montgomery Blair High School`_.

Katie Travis
    developed the automated 
    ``--inline`` optimization code for ``Variable`` objects 
    while she was a SURF_ student from `Smith College`_.
  
Max Gibiansky
    added support for the Trilinos_ solvers while he was a SURF_ student
    from `Harvey Mudd College`_

`Andrew Reeve`_
    added support for anistropic diffusion coefficients while he was on 
    sabbatical from the `University of Maine`_.

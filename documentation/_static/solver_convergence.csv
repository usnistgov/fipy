|KSP_CONVERGED_ATOL|_,,|PySparse_2|_,,,"Converged, residual is as small as seems reasonable on this machine."
,,|PySparse_1|_,,,"Converged, :math:`\mathbf{b} = 0`, so the exact solution is :math:`\mathbf{x} = 0`."

,|AMGX_SOLVE_FAILED|_,,|SciPy_lt0|_,,Illegal input or breakdown
|KSP_DIVERGED_BREAKDOWN|_,,,,|AZ_breakdown|_,The iterative solver has broken down.
|KSP_DIVERGED_BREAKDOWN_BICG|_,,,,,"Initial residual is orthogonal to preconditioned initial residual. Try a different preconditioner, or a different initial Level.continue to enlarge the Krylov space."

|KSP_DIVERGED_PC_FAILED|_,,|PySparse_neg2|_,,,The system involving the preconditioner was ill-conditioned.
|KSP_DIVERGED_INDEFINITE_PC|_,,|PySparse_neg3|_,,,"An inner product of the form :math:`\mathbf{x}^T \mathsf{P}^{-1} \mathbf{x}` was not positive, so the preconditioning matrix :math:`\mathsf{P}` does not appear to be positive definite."
|KSP_DIVERGED_INDEFINITE_MAT|_,,|PySparse_neg4|_,,|AZ_ill_cond|_,The matrix :math:`\mathsf{L}` appears to be ill-conditioned.
,,|PySparse_neg5|_,,,The method stagnated.
|KSP_DIVERGED_NANORINF|_,,|PySparse_neg6|_,,,A scalar quantity became too small or too large to continue computing.
,,,,|AZ_loss|_,The iterative solver has terminated due to a lack of accuracy in the recursive residual (caused by rounding errors).
|KSP_DIVERGED_NULL|_,,,,,
|KSP_DIVERGED_DTOL|_,,,,,The residual norm increased by a factor of ``divtol``.
|KSP_DIVERGED_NONSYMMETRIC|_,,,,,"It appears the operator or preconditioner is not symmetric and this Krylov method (``KSPCG``, ``KSPMINRES``, ``KSPCR``) requires symmetry."

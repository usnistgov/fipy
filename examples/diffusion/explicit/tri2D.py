"""

This input file again solves a 1D diffusion problem as in
`./examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D.py`. The difference in this example is
that the solution method is explicit. The equation used is the
`ExplicitDiffusionEquation`. In this case many steps have to be taken to reach
equilibrum. The `timeStepDuration` parameter specifies the size of each time step
and `steps` is the number of time steps.

    >>> dx = 1.
    >>> dy = 1.
    >>> nx = 10
    >>> ny = 1
    >>> valueLeft = 0.
    >>> valueRight = 1.
    >>> timeStepDuration = 0.02
    >>> steps = 10

A loop is required to execute the necessary time steps:

    >>> for step in range(steps):
    ...     eq.solve(var, solver=solver, dt=timeStepDuration)
    
The result is again tested in the same way:

    >>> Lx = nx * dx
    >>> x = mesh.cellCenters[0]
    >>> print var.allclose(answer, rtol = 1e-8)
    1

"""

This example is a 1D steady state diffusion test case as in
`./examples/diffusion/variable/mesh2x1/input.py` with then
number of cells set to `nx = 10`.

A simple analytical answer can be used to test the result:
   >>> DiffusionTerm(coeff = diffCoeff).solve(var)
   >>> if __name__ == "__main__":
   ...     viewer = Viewer(vars = var)
   ...     viewer.plot()
   >>> x = mesh.cellCenters[0]
   >>> values = numerix.where(x < 3. * L / 4., 10 * x - 9. * L / 4., x + 18. * L / 4.)
   >>> values = numerix.where(x < L / 4., x, values)
   >>> print var.allclose(values, atol = 1e-8, rtol = 1e-8)

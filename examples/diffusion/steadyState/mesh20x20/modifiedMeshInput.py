This input file again solves a 1D diffusion problem as in
`./examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D/input.py`. The difference
being that it uses a triangular mesh loaded in using the
:class:`~fipy.meshes.gmshMesh.Gmsh2D` object.

The result is again tested in the same way:

>>> from fipy import Gmsh2D, CellVariable, DiffusionTerm, Viewer
>>> from fipy.tools import numerix

>>> valueLeft = 0.
>>> valueRight = 1.

>>> mesh = Gmsh2D('''
...     cellSize = 0.5;
...     Point(2) = {0, 0, 0, cellSize};
...     Point(3) = {20, 0, 0, cellSize};
...     Point(4) = {20, 20, 0, cellSize};
...     Point(5) = {0, 20, 0, cellSize};
...
...     Line(6) = {2, 3};
...     Line(7) = {3, 4};
...     Line(8) = {4, 5};
...     Line(9) = {5, 2};
...
...     Line Loop(10) = {6, 7, 8, 9};
...
...     Plane Surface(11) = {10};
...     ''') # doctest: +GMSH

>>> var = CellVariable(name = "solution variable",
...               mesh = mesh,
...               value = valueLeft) # doctest: +GMSH

>>> var.constrain(valueLeft, mesh.facesLeft) # doctest: +GMSH
>>> var.constrain(valueRight, mesh.facesRight) # doctest: +GMSH

>>> DiffusionTerm().solve(var) # doctest: +GMSH

>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
...     viewer = Viewer(vars = var)
...     viewer.plot()
...     varArray = numerix.array(var)
...     x = mesh.cellCenters[0]
...     analyticalArray = valueLeft + (valueRight - valueLeft) * x / 20
...     errorArray = varArray - analyticalArray
...     errorVar = CellVariable(name = "absolute error",
...                    mesh = mesh,
...                    value = abs(errorArray))
...     errorViewer = Viewer(vars = errorVar)
...     errorViewer.plot()
...
...     NonOrthoVar = CellVariable(name = "non-orthogonality",
...                           mesh = mesh,
...                           value = mesh._nonOrthogonality)
...     NOViewer = Viewer(vars = NonOrthoVar)
...
...
...     NOViewer.plot()
...     raw_input("finished")
... else:
...     Lx = 20
...     x = mesh.cellCenters[0] # doctest: +GMSH
...     analyticalArray = valueLeft + (valueRight - valueLeft) * x / Lx # doctest: +GMSH
...     print var.allclose(analyticalArray, atol = 0.025) # doctest: +GMSH
1

>>> max(mesh._nonOrthogonality) < 0.51 # doctest: +GMSH
True



Note that this test case will only work if you run it by running the
main FiPy test suite. If you run it directly from the directory it is
in it will not be able to find the mesh file.

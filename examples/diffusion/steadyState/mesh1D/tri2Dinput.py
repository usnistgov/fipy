r"""

To run this example from the base FiPy directory type::

    $ python examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D/tri2Dinput.py

at the command line. A contour plot should appear and the word `finished`
in the terminal.

This example is similar to the example found in
:mod:`examples.diffusion.steadyState.mesh1D.input`, however, the `mesh` is a
`Tri2D` object rather than a `Grid2D` object.

Here, one time step is executed to implicitly find the steady state
solution.

    >>> DiffusionTerm().solve(var)

To test the solution, the analytical result is required. The `x`
coordinates from the mesh are gathered and the length of the domain,
`Lx`, is calculated.  An array, `analyticalArray`, is calculated to
compare with the numerical result,

    >>> x = mesh.cellCenters[0]
    >>> Lx = nx * dx
    >>> analyticalArray = valueLeft + (valueRight - valueLeft) * x / Lx

Finally the analytical and numerical results are compared with a
tolerance of `1e-10`.

    >>> print(var.allclose(analyticalArray))
    1

"""

This input file again solves a 1D diffusion problem as in::

    $ examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D/input.py

The difference being that the mesh is two dimensional.

The result is again tested in the same way:

    >>> DiffusionTerm().solve(var)
    >>> Lx = nx * dx
    >>> x = mesh.cellCenters[0]
    >>> analyticalArray = valueLeft + (valueRight - valueLeft) * x / Lx
    >>> print var.allclose(analyticalArray, rtol = 1e-9)
    1

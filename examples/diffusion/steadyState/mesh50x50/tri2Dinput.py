This input file again solves a 1D diffusion problem as in
`./examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D/input.py`. The difference
being that the mesh size is given by

    >>> nx = 50
    >>> ny = 50

The result is again tested in the same way:

    >>> DiffusionTerm().solve(var)
    >>> Lx = nx * dx
    >>> x = mesh.cellCenters[0]
    >>> analyticalArray = valueLeft + (valueRight - valueLeft) * x / Lx
    >>> print var.allclose(analyticalArray, atol = 1e-7)
    1

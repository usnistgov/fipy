r"""Solve a dendritic solidification problem.

To convert a liquid material to a solid,  it must be cooled to a
temperature below its melting point (known as "undercooling" or "supercooling"). The rate of
solidification is often assumed (and experimentally found) to be proportional to the
undercooling. Under the right circumstances, the
solidification front can become unstable, leading to dendritic
patterns.
Warren, Kobayashi, Lobkovsky and Carter :cite:`WarrenPolycrystal`
have described a phase field model ("Allen-Cahn", "non-conserved
Ginsberg-Landau", or "model A" of Hohenberg & Halperin) of such a system,
including the effects of discrete crystalline orientations (anisotropy).

We start with a regular 2D Cartesian mesh

>>> from fipy import Variable, CellVariable, Grid2D, TransientTerm, DiffusionTerm, ImplicitSourceTerm, Viewer, Matplotlib2DGridViewer
>>> from fipy.tools import numerix
>>> dx = dy = 0.025
>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
...     nx = ny = 500
... else:
...     nx = ny = 20
>>> mesh = Grid2D(dx=dx, dy=dy, nx=nx, ny=ny)

and we'll take fixed timesteps

>>> dt = 5e-4

We consider the simultaneous evolution of a "phase field" variable
:math:`\phi` (taken to be 0 in the liquid phase and 1 in the solid)

>>> phase = CellVariable(name=r'$\phi$', mesh=mesh, hasOld=True)

and a dimensionless undercooling
:math:`\Delta T` (:math:`\Delta T = 0` at the melting point)

>>> dT = CellVariable(name=r'$\Delta T$', mesh=mesh, hasOld=True)

The ``hasOld`` flag causes the storage of the value of variable from the
previous timestep. This is necessary for solving equations with
non-linear coefficients or for coupling between PDEs.

The governing equation for the temperature field is the heat flux
equation, with a source due to the latent heat of solidification

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \Delta T}{\partial t}
   = D_T \nabla^2 \Delta T
   + \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}

>>> DT = 2.25
>>> heatEq = (TransientTerm()
...           == DiffusionTerm(DT)
...           + (phase - phase.old) / dt)

The governing equation for the phase field is

.. math::

   \tau_{\phi} \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}
   = \nabla \cdot \mathsf{D} \nabla \phi
   +   \phi ( 1 - \phi ) m ( \phi , \Delta T)

where

.. math::

   m(\phi, \Delta T)
   = \phi - \frac{1}{2}
   - \frac{ \kappa_1 }{ \pi } \arctan \left( \kappa_2 \Delta T \right)

represents a source of anisotropy. The coefficient
:math:`\mathsf{D}`
is an anisotropic diffusion tensor in two dimensions

.. math::

   \mathsf{D} = \alpha^2 \left( 1 + c \beta \right)
   \left[
   \begin{matrix}
       1 + c \beta & -c \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \psi} \\
       c \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \psi} & 1 + c \beta
   \end{matrix}
   \right]

where :math:`\beta = \frac{ 1 - \Phi^2 } { 1 + \Phi^2}`,
:math:`\Phi = \tan \left( \frac{ N } { 2 } \psi \right)`,
:math:`\psi = \theta
+ \arctan \frac{\partial \phi / \partial y}{\partial \phi / \partial x}`,
:math:`\theta` is the orientation, and :math:`N` is the symmetry.

.. index::
   single: :math:`\pi`
   single: pi
   single: arctan
   single: arctan2
   single: tan

>>> alpha = 0.015
>>> c = 0.02
>>> N = 6.
>>> theta = numerix.pi / 8.
>>> psi = theta + numerix.arctan2(phase.faceGrad[1],
...                               phase.faceGrad[0])
>>> Phi = numerix.tan(N * psi / 2)
>>> PhiSq = Phi**2
>>> beta = (1. - PhiSq) / (1. + PhiSq)
>>> DbetaDpsi = -N * 2 * Phi / (1 + PhiSq)
>>> Ddia = (1.+ c * beta)
>>> Doff = c * DbetaDpsi
>>> I0 = Variable(value=((1, 0), (0, 1)))
>>> I1 = Variable(value=((0, -1), (1, 0)))
>>> D = alpha**2 * (1.+ c * beta) * (Ddia * I0 + Doff * I1)

With these expressions defined, we can construct the phase field equation
as

>>> tau = 3e-4
>>> kappa1 = 0.9
>>> kappa2 = 20.
>>> phaseEq = (TransientTerm(tau)
...            == DiffusionTerm(D)
...            + ImplicitSourceTerm((phase - 0.5 - kappa1 / numerix.pi * numerix.arctan(kappa2 * dT))
...                                 * (1 - phase)))

We seed a circular solidified region in the center

>>> radius = dx * 5.
>>> C = (nx * dx / 2, ny * dy / 2)
>>> x, y = mesh.cellCenters
>>> phase.setValue(1., where=((x - C[0])**2 + (y - C[1])**2) < radius**2)

and quench the entire simulation domain below the melting point

>>> dT.setValue(-0.5)

In a real solidification process, dendritic branching is induced by small thermal
fluctuations along an otherwise smooth surface, but the granularity of the
:class:`~fipy.meshes.mesh.Mesh` is enough "noise" in this case, so we don't need to explicitly
introduce randomness, the way we did in the Cahn-Hilliard problem.

FiPy's viewers are utilitarian, striving to let the user see *something*,
regardless of their operating system or installed packages, so you won't
be able to simultaneously view two fields "out of the box", but, because all of Python is
accessible and FiPy is object oriented, it is not hard to adapt one of the
existing viewers to create a specialized display:

>>> if __name__ == "__main__":
...     try:
...         import pylab
...         class DendriteViewer(Matplotlib2DGridViewer):
...             def __init__(self, phase, dT, title=None, limits={}, **kwlimits):
...                 self.phase = phase
...                 self.contour = None
...                 Matplotlib2DGridViewer.__init__(self, vars=(dT,), title=title,
...                                                 cmap=pylab.cm.hot,
...                                                 limits=limits, **kwlimits)
... 
...             def _plot(self):
...                 Matplotlib2DGridViewer._plot(self)
... 
...                 if self.contour is not None:
...                     for c in self.contour.collections:
...                         c.remove()
... 
...                 mesh = self.phase.mesh
...                 shape = mesh.shape
...                 x, y = mesh.cellCenters
...                 z = self.phase.value
...                 x, y, z = [a.reshape(shape, order='F') for a in (x, y, z)]
... 
...                 self.contour = self.axes.contour(x, y, z, (0.5,))
... 
...         viewer = DendriteViewer(phase=phase, dT=dT,
...                                 title=r"%s & %s" % (phase.name, dT.name),
...                                 datamin=-0.1, datamax=0.05)
...     except ImportError:
...         viewer = MultiViewer(viewers=(Viewer(vars=phase),
...                                       Viewer(vars=dT,
...                                              datamin=-0.5,
...                                              datamax=0.5)))

and iterate the solution in time, plotting as we go,

>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
...     steps = 10000
... else:
...     steps = 10
>>> from builtins import range
>>> for i in range(steps):
...     phase.updateOld()
...     dT.updateOld()
...     phaseEq.solve(phase, dt=dt)
...     heatEq.solve(dT, dt=dt)
...     if __name__ == "__main__" and (i % 10 == 0):
...         viewer.plot()

The non-uniform temperature results from the release of latent
heat at the solidifying interface. The dendrite arms grow fastest
where the temperature gradient is steepest.

We note that this FiPy simulation is written in about 50 lines of code (excluding the
custom viewer), compared with over 800 lines of (fairly lucid) FORTRAN code used for
the figures in :cite:`WarrenPolycrystal`.

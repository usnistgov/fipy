r"""Solve the Navier-Stokes equation in the viscous limit.

Many thanks to Benny Malengier <bm@cage.ugent.be> for reworking this example and
actually making it work correctly... see `#209 <https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy/issues/209>`_

This example is an implementation of a rudimentary Stokes solver on a collocated
grid.  It solves the Navier-Stokes equation in the viscous limit,

.. math::

   \nabla \cdot \left( \mu \nabla \vec{u} \right) = \nabla p

and the
continuity equation,

.. math::

   \nabla \cdot \vec{u} = 0

where :math:`\vec{u}` is the fluid velocity, :math:`p` is the pressure and :math:`\mu`
is the viscosity.  The domain in this example is a square cavity
of unit dimensions with a moving lid of unit speed.  This example
uses the SIMPLE algorithm with Rhie-Chow interpolation for collocated grids to solve
the pressure-momentum coupling. Some of the details of the
algorithm will be highlighted below but a good reference for this
material is Ferziger and Peric :cite:`ferziger` and Rossow :cite:`rossow:2003`. The
solution has a high degree of error close to the corners of the
domain for the pressure but does a reasonable job of predicting
the velocities away from the boundaries. A number of aspects of
:term:`FiPy` need to be improved to have a first class flow
solver. These include, higher order spatial diffusion terms,
proper wall boundary conditions, improved mass flux evaluation and
extrapolation of cell values to the boundaries using gradients.

In the table below a comparison is made with the Dolfyn_ open source
code on a 100 by 100 grid. The table shows the frequency of values
that fall within the given error confidence bands. Dolfyn_ has the
added features described above. When these features are switched off
the results of Dolfyn_
and :term:`FiPy` are identical.

To start, some parameters are declared.

>>> from fipy import CellVariable, FaceVariable, Grid2D, DiffusionTerm, Viewer
>>> from fipy.tools import numerix

>>> L = 1.0
>>> N = 50
>>> dL = L / N
>>> viscosity = 1
>>> U = 1.
>>> #0.8 for pressure and 0.5 for velocity are typical relaxation values for SIMPLE
>>> pressureRelaxation = 0.8
>>> velocityRelaxation = 0.5
>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
...     sweeps = 300
... else:
...     sweeps = 5

Build the mesh.

.. index::
   single: Grid2D

>>> mesh = Grid2D(nx=N, ny=N, dx=dL, dy=dL)

Declare the variables.

.. index::
   single: CellVariable

>>> pressure = CellVariable(mesh=mesh, name='pressure')
>>> pressureCorrection = CellVariable(mesh=mesh)
>>> xVelocity = CellVariable(mesh=mesh, name='X velocity')
>>> yVelocity = CellVariable(mesh=mesh, name='Y velocity')

The velocity is required as a rank-1
:class:`~fipy.variables.faceVariable.FaceVariable` for calculating the mass
flux. This is required by the Rhie-Chow correction to avoid pressure/velocity
decoupling.

>>> velocity = FaceVariable(mesh=mesh, rank=1)

Build the Stokes equations in the cell centers.

>>> xVelocityEq = DiffusionTerm(coeff=viscosity) - pressure.grad.dot([1., 0.])
>>> yVelocityEq = DiffusionTerm(coeff=viscosity) - pressure.grad.dot([0., 1.])

In this example the SIMPLE algorithm is used to couple the
pressure and momentum equations. Let us assume we have solved the
discretized momentum equations using a guessed pressure field
:math:`p^{\ast}` to obtain a velocity field :math:`\vec{u}^{\ast}`. That is
:math:`\vec{u}^{\ast}` is found from

.. math::

   a_P \vec{u}^{\ast}_P = \sum_f a_A \vec{u}^{\ast}_A - V_P (\nabla p^{\ast})_P

We would like to somehow correct these initial fields to satisfy both the
discretized momentum and continuity equations. We now try to
correct these initial fields with a correction such that
:math:`\vec{u} = \vec{u}^{\ast} + \vec{u}'` and :math:`p = p^{\ast} + p'`, where
:math:`\vec{u}` and :math:`p` now satisfy the momentum and continuity
equations. Substituting the exact solution into the equations we
obtain,

.. math::

   \nabla \cdot \left( \mu \nabla \vec{u}' \right) = \nabla p'

and

.. math::

   \nabla \cdot \vec{u}^{\ast} + \nabla \cdot \vec{u}' = 0

We now use the discretized form of the equations to write the velocity
correction in terms of the pressure correction. The discretized
form of the above equation results in an equation for :math:`p = p'`,

.. math::

   a_P \vec{u}'_P = \sum_f a_A \vec{u}'_A - V_P (\nabla p')_P

where notation from :ref:`section:linear-equations` is used. The SIMPLE
algorithm drops the second term in the above equation to leave,

.. math::

   \vec{u}'_{P} = - \frac{ V_P (\nabla p')_P }{ a_P }

By substituting the above expression into the continuity equations we
obtain the pressure correction equation,

.. math::

   \nabla \frac{V_P}{a_P} \cdot \nabla p' = \nabla \cdot \vec{u}^{\ast}

In the discretized version of the above equation :math:`V_P / a_P` is
approximated at the face by :math:`A_f d_{AP} / (a_P)_f`. In :term:`FiPy` the
pressure correction equation can be written as,

>>> ap = CellVariable(mesh=mesh, value=1.)
>>> coeff = 1./ ap.arithmeticFaceValue*mesh._faceAreas * mesh._cellDistances
>>> pressureCorrectionEq = DiffusionTerm(coeff=coeff) - velocity.divergence

Above would work good on a staggered grid, however, on a colocated grid as :term:`FiPy`
uses, the term
``velocity``.\ :attr:`~fipy.variables.faceVariable.FaceVariable.divergence` will
cause oscillations in the pressure solution as velocity is a face variable. We
can apply the Rhie-Chow correction terms for this. In this an intermediate
velocity term :math:`u^\diamond` is considered which does not contain the
pressure corrections:

.. math::

   \vec{u}^{\diamond}_P = \vec{u}^{\ast}_P + \frac{V_P}{a_P} (\nabla p^{\ast})_P
   = \sum_f \frac{a_A}{a_P} \vec{u}^{\ast}_A

This velocity is interpolated at the edges, after which the pressure correction
term is added again, but now considered at the edge:

.. math::

  \vec{u}_f = \frac{1}{2}(\vec{u}^{\diamond}_L + \vec{u}^{\diamond}_R))
  - \left(\frac{V}{a_P}\right)_{\mathrm{avg\ L,R}} (\nabla p^{\ast}_f)

where :math:`\left(\frac{V}{a_P}\right)_{\mathrm{avg\ L,R}}`  is assumed a good approximation at the edge. Here L
and R denote the two cells adjacent to the face. Expanding the
not calculated terms we arrive at

.. math::

  \vec{u}_f = \frac{1}{2}(\vec{u}^{\ast}_L + \vec{u}^{\ast}_R))
  + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V}{a_P}\right)_{\mathrm{avg\ L,R}} (\nabla p^{\ast}_L+ \nabla p^{\ast}_R)
  - \left(\frac{V}{a_P}\right)_{\mathrm{avg\ L,R}} (\nabla p^{\ast}_f)

where we have replaced the coefficients of the cell pressure gradients by
an averaged value over the edge.
This formula has the consequence that the velocity on a face depends not only
on the pressure of the adjacent cells, but also on the cells further away, which
removes the unphysical pressure oscillations. We start by introducing needed
terms

>>> from fipy.variables.faceGradVariable import _FaceGradVariable
>>> volume = CellVariable(mesh=mesh, value=mesh.cellVolumes, name='Volume')
>>> contrvolume=volume.arithmeticFaceValue

And set up the velocity with this formula in the SIMPLE loop.
Now, set up the no-slip boundary conditions

>>> xVelocity.constrain(0., mesh.facesRight | mesh.facesLeft | mesh.facesBottom)
>>> xVelocity.constrain(U, mesh.facesTop)
>>> yVelocity.constrain(0., mesh.exteriorFaces)
>>> X, Y = mesh.faceCenters
>>> pressureCorrection.constrain(0., mesh.facesLeft & (Y < dL))

Set up the viewers,

.. index::
   module: fipy.viewers

>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
...     viewer = Viewer(vars=(pressure, xVelocity, yVelocity, velocity),
...                xmin=0., xmax=1., ymin=0., ymax=1., colorbar=True)

Below, we iterate for a set number of sweeps. We use the
:meth:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.sweep` method instead of
:meth:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.solve` because we require the residual for output.
We also use the :meth:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.cacheMatrix`,
:py:attr:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.matrix`,
:meth:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.cacheRHSvector` and
:py:attr:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.RHSvector` because both the matrix and RHS
vector are required by the SIMPLE algorithm. Additionally, the
:meth:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.sweep` method is passed an ``underRelaxation``
factor to relax the solution. This argument cannot be passed to
:meth:`~fipy.terms.term.Term.solve`.

This example solves the steady-state cylindrical convection-diffusion equation
given by

.. math::

   \nabla \cdot \left(D \nabla \phi + \vec{u} \phi \right) = 0

with coefficients :math:`D = 1` and :math:`\vec{u} = (10,)`, or

>>> diffCoeff = 1.
>>> convCoeff = ((10.,),)
    
We define a 1D cylindrical mesh representing an anulus. The mesh has a
non-constant cell spacing.

>>> from fipy import CellVariable, CylindricalGrid1D, DiffusionTerm, ExponentialConvectionTerm, Viewer
>>> from fipy.tools import numerix

>>> r0 = 1.
>>> r1 = 2.
>>> nr = 100
>>> Rratio = (r1 / r0)**(1 / float(nr))
>>> dr = r0 * (Rratio - 1) * Rratio**numerix.arange(nr)
>>> mesh = CylindricalGrid1D(dr=dr) + ((r0,),)

>>> valueLeft = 0.
>>> valueRight = 1.

The solution variable is initialized to ``valueLeft``:
    
>>> var = CellVariable(mesh=mesh, name = "variable")

and impose the boundary conditions

.. math

   \phi = \begin{cases}
   0& \text{at $r = r_0$,} \\
   1& \text{at $r = r_1$,}
   \end{cases}
   
with
   
>>> var.constrain(valueLeft, mesh.facesLeft)
>>> var.constrain(valueRight, mesh.facesRight)

The equation is created with the :class:`~fipy.terms.diffusionTerm.DiffusionTerm` and
:class:`~fipy.terms.exponentialConvectionTerm.ExponentialConvectionTerm`.

>>> eq = (DiffusionTerm(coeff=diffCoeff)
...       + ExponentialConvectionTerm(coeff=convCoeff))
   
More details of the benefits and drawbacks of each type of convection
term can be found in :ref:`sec:NumericalSchemes`.
Essentially, the :class:`~fipy.terms.exponentialConvectionTerm.ExponentialConvectionTerm` and :class:`~fipy.terms.powerLawConvectionTerm.PowerLawConvectionTerm` will
both handle most types of convection-diffusion cases, with the
:class:`~fipy.terms.powerLawConvectionTerm.PowerLawConvectionTerm` being more efficient.

We solve the equation

>>> eq.solve(var=var)
   
and test the solution against the analytical result

.. math::

   \phi = \exp{\frac{u}{D} \left(r_1 - r\right)} \left( \frac{ \ei{\frac{u r_0}{D}} - \ei{\frac{u r}{D}} }{ \ei{\frac{u r_0}{D}} - \ei{\frac{u r_1}{D}} } \right)
   
or

.. index:: exp

>>> axis = 0

>>> try:
...     U = convCoeff[0][0]
...     from scipy.special import expi # doctest: +SCIPY
...     r = mesh.cellCenters[axis]
...     AA = numerix.exp(U / diffCoeff * (r1 - r))
...     BB = expi(U * r0 / diffCoeff) - expi(U * r / diffCoeff) # doctest: +SCIPY
...     CC = expi(U * r0 / diffCoeff) - expi(U * r1 / diffCoeff) # doctest: +SCIPY
...     analyticalArray = AA * BB / CC # doctest: +SCIPY
... except ImportError:
...     print "The SciPy library is unavailable. It is required for testing purposes."

>>> print var.allclose(analyticalArray, atol=1e-3) # doctest: +SCIPY
1
   
If the problem is run interactively, we can view the result:

.. index::
   module: fipy.viewers

>>> if __name__ == '__main__':
...     viewer = Viewer(vars=var)
...     viewer.plot()
"""
__docformat__ = 'restructuredtext'
     
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import fipy.tests.doctestPlus
    exec(fipy.tests.doctestPlus._getScript())
    
    raw_input('finished')

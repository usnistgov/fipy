r"""Solve a convection problem with a source.

This example solves the equation

.. math::

   \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + \alpha \phi = 0

with :math:`\phi \left( 0 \right) = 1` at :math:`x = 0`. The boundary
condition at :math:`x = L` is an outflow boundary condition requiring
the use of an artificial constraint to be set on the right hand side
faces. Exterior faces without constraints are considered to have zero
outflow. An :class:`~fipy.terms.implicitSourceTerm.ImplicitSourceTerm`
object will be used to represent this term. The derivative of
:math:`\phi` can be represented by a
:class:`~fipy.terms.ConvectionTerm` with a constant unitary velocity
field from left to right. The following is an example code that
includes a test against the analytical result.

>>> from fipy import CellVariable, Grid1D, DiffusionTerm, PowerLawConvectionTerm, ImplicitSourceTerm, Viewer
>>> from fipy.tools import numerix

>>> L = 10.
>>> nx = 5000
>>> dx =  L / nx
>>> mesh = Grid1D(dx=dx, nx=nx)
>>> phi0 = 1.0
>>> alpha = 1.0
>>> phi = CellVariable(name=r"$\phi$", mesh=mesh, value=phi0)
>>> solution = CellVariable(name=r"solution", mesh=mesh, value=phi0 * numerix.exp(-alpha * mesh.cellCenters[0]))

>>> from fipy import input
>>> if __name__ == "__main__":
...     viewer = Viewer(vars=(phi, solution))
...     viewer.plot()
...     input("press key to continue")

>>> phi.constrain(phi0, mesh.facesLeft)
>>> ## fake outflow condition
>>> phi.faceGrad.constrain([0], mesh.facesRight)

>>> eq = PowerLawConvectionTerm((1,)) + ImplicitSourceTerm(alpha)
>>> eq.solve(phi)
>>> print(numerix.allclose(phi, phi0 * numerix.exp(-alpha * mesh.cellCenters[0]), atol=1e-3))
True

>>> from fipy import input
>>> if __name__ == "__main__":
...     viewer = Viewer(vars=(phi, solution))
...     viewer.plot()
...     input("finished")

.. _INSTALLATION:

============
Installation
============

The :term:`FiPy` finite volume PDE solver relies on several
third-party packages.  It is *best to obtain and install those first*
before attempting to install :term:`FiPy`. This document explains how
to install :term:`FiPy`, not how to use it. See :ref:`USAGE`
for details on how to use :term:`FiPy`.

.. note::

   It may be useful to set up a :ref:`ENVIRONMENT` before beginning
   the installation process.

Pre-Installed on Binder
-----------------------

A full :term:`FiPy` installation is available for basic exploration on
Binder_. The default notebook gives a rudimentary introduction to :term:`FiPy`
syntax and, like any `Jupyter Notebook`_ interface, tab completion will help
you explore the package interactively.

------------------
Recommended Method
------------------

|CondaForge|_

.. attention::

   There are many ways to obtain the software
   packages necessary to run :term:`FiPy`, but the most expedient way is
   with the conda_ package manager.  In addition to the scientific
   :term:`Python` stack, conda_ also provides virtual environment
   management.  Keeping separate installations is useful *e.g.* for
   comparing :term:`Python` 2 and :term:`Python` 3 software stacks, or when
   the user does not have sufficient privileges to install software
   system-wide.

   In addition to the default packages, many other developers provide
   "channels" to distribute their own builds of a variety of software.
   These days, the most useful channel is `conda-forge`, which provides
   everything necessary to install :term:`FiPy`.

* `install Miniconda`_ on your computer
* run::

    $ conda create --name <MYFIPYENV> --channel conda-forge python=<PYTHONVERSION> fipy

  .. note::

     This command creates a self-contained conda_ environment and then
     downloads and populates the environment with the prerequisites for
     :term:`FiPy` from the conda-forge_ channel at https://anaconda.org.

  .. attention::

     Windows x86_64 is fully supported, but this does not work on
     Windows x86_32, as conda-forge_ no longer supports that platform.  For
     Python 2.7.x, you should be able to do::

      conda create --name <MYFIPYENV> --channel conda-forge python=2.7 numpy scipy matplotlib pysparse mayavi weave

     and for Python 3.x, you should be able to do::

      conda create --name <MYFIPYENV> --channel conda-forge python=3.6 numpy scipy matplotlib pysparse

     followed, for either, by::

      activate <MYFIPYENV>
      pip install fipy

* enable this new environment with::

    $ source activate <MYFIPYENV>

  .. note::

     ``$ activate <MYFIPYENV>`` on Windows_

* move on to :ref:`USAGE`.

  .. note::

     On Linux_ and `Mac OS X`_, you should have a pretty complete system
     to run and visualize :term:`FiPy` simulations. On Windows_, there
     are fewer packages available via conda_, particularly amongst the
     sparse matrix :ref:`SOLVERS`, but the system still should be
     functional. Significantly, you will need to download and install
     :term:`Gmsh` manually when using Python 2.7.

.. attention::

   When installed via conda_ or :term:`pip`, :term:`FiPy` will not include
   its :ref:`examples <part:examples>`.  These can be obtained by
   `cloning the repository`_ or downloading a `compressed archive`_.

--------------
Obtaining FiPy
--------------

:term:`FiPy` is freely available for download via Git_ or as a
`compressed archive`_. Please see
:ref:`documentation:GIT` for instructions on obtaining :term:`FiPy`
with Git_.

.. warning::

   Keep in mind that if you choose to download the `compressed
   archive`_ you will then need to preserve your changes when upgrades
   to :term:`FiPy` become available (upgrades via Git_ will handle
   this issue automatically).

.. _Git:       https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy
.. _compressed archive:      https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy/releases

---------------
Installing FiPy
---------------

Details of the `Required Packages`_ and links are given below,
but for the courageous and the
impatient, :term:`FiPy` can be up and running quickly by simply
installing the following prerequisite packages on your system:

 * Python_

 * NumPy_

 * At least one of the :ref:`SOLVERS`

 * At least one of the :ref:`VIEWERS` (:term:`FiPy`'s tests will run
   without a viewer, but you'll want one for any practical work)

Other :ref:`OPTIONALPACKAGES` add greatly to :term:`FiPy`'s
capabilities, but are not necessary for an initial installation or to
simply run the test suite.

It is not necessary to formally install :term:`FiPy`, but if you wish
to do so and you are confident that all of the requisite packages have
been installed properly, you can install it by typing::

    $ pip install fipy

or by unpacking the archive and typing::

    $ python setup.py install

at the command line in the base :term:`FiPy` directory. You can also install
:term:`FiPy` in "development mode" by typing::

    $ python setup.py develop

which allows the source code to be altered in place and executed without
issuing further installation commands.

Alternatively, you may choose not to formally install :term:`FiPy` and
to simply work within the base directory instead. In this case or if you
are making a non-standard install (without admin privileges), read about
setting up your :ref:`ENVIRONMENT` before beginning the installation
process.

.. _REQUIREDPACKAGES:

-----------------
Required Packages
-----------------

.. warning:

   :term:`FiPy` will not run if the following items are not installed.

Python
======

http://www.python.org/

:term:`FiPy` is written in the :term:`Python` language and requires a
:term:`Python` installation to run. :term:`Python` comes pre-installed
on many operating systems, which you can check by opening a terminal
and typing ``python``, *e.g.*::

    $ python
    Python 2.7.15 | ...
    ...
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

If necessary, you can download_ and install it for your platform
<http://www.python.org/download>.

.. note::

   :term:`FiPy` requires at least version 2.7.x of :term:`Python`. See
   the specialized instructions if you plan on :ref:`RunningUnderPython3`.

.. _download: http://www.python.org/download/

:term:`Python` along with many of :term:`FiPy`'s required and optional
packages is available with one of the following distributions.

NumPy
=====

http://numpy.scipy.org

Obtain and install the :term:`NumPy` package. :term:`FiPy` requires at
least version 1.0 of NumPy_.

.. _OPTIONALPACKAGES:

-----------------
Optional Packages
-----------------

.. note:

    The following packages are not required to run :term:`FiPy`, but they can
    be helpful.

Gmsh
====

http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/

:term:`Gmsh` is an application that allows the creation of irregular meshes.

SciPy
=====

http://www.scipy.org/

:term:`SciPy` provides a large collection of functions and tools that can
be useful for running and analyzing :term:`FiPy` simulations. Significantly
improved performance has been achieved with the judicious use of C language
inlining (see the :ref:`FlagsAndEnvironmentVariables` section for more
details), via the :mod:`weave` module.

.. note:

    A handful of test cases use functions from the :term:`SciPy`
    library and will throw errors if it is missing.

------------------
Level Set Packages
------------------

To use the level set (:cite:`levelSetBook`) components of :term:`FiPy` one of the following is
required.

.. _SCIKITFMM:

Scikit-fmm
==========

http://packages.python.org/scikit-fmm/

Scikit-fmm_ is a python extension module which implements the fast
marching method.

.. _Scikit-fmm: http://packages.python.org/scikit-fmm/

.. _LSMLIBDOC:

LSMLIB
======

http://ktchu.serendipityresearch.org/software/lsmlib/index.html

The Level Set Method Library (LSMLIB_) provides support for the serial
and parallel simulation of implicit surface and curve dynamics in two-
and three-dimensions.

Install LSMLIB_ as per the instructions on the website. Additionally
PyLSMLIB_ is required. To install, follow the instructions on the
website,
https://github.com/ktchu/LSMLIB/tree/master/pylsmlib#pylsmlib.

.. _ENVIRONMENT:

-----------------------
Development Environment
-----------------------

It is often preferable to not formally install packages in the system
directories. The reasons for this include:

 * developing or altering the package source code,

 * trying out a new package along with its dependencies without
   violating a working system,

 * dealing with conflicting packages and dependencies,

 * or not having admin privileges.

To avoid tampering with the system Python_ installation, you can employ one
of the utilities that manage packages and their dependencies independently
of the system package manager and the system directories.  These utilities
include conda_, Nix_, Stow_, Virtualenv_ and Buildout_, amongst others.
Conda_ and Nix_ are only ones of these we have the resources to support.

Our preferred development environment is set up with::

   $ conda create --name <MYFIPYENV> --channel conda-forge python=<PYTHONVERSION> fipy
   $ source activate <MYFIPYENV>
   $ pip install scikit-fmm
   $ conda remove --channel conda-forge fipy
   $ git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/fipy.git
   $ cd fipy
   $ python setup.py develop

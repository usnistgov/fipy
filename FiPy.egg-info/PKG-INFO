        Overview
        ========
        
        .. only:: latex
        
           :term:`FiPy` is an object oriented, partial differential equation (PDE) solver,
           written in :term:`Python`, based on a standard finite volume (FV)
           approach.  The framework has been developed in the `Metallurgy Division`_
           and Center for Theoretical and Computational Materials Science (CTCMS_), in
           the Material Measurement Laboratory (MML_) at the National
           Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST_).
        
           The solution of coupled sets of PDEs is ubiquitous to the numerical
           simulation of science problems.  Numerous PDE solvers exist, using a
           variety of languages and numerical approaches. Many are proprietary,
           expensive and difficult to customize.  As a result, scientists spend
           considerable resources repeatedly developing limited tools for
           specific problems.  Our approach, combining the FV method and :term:`Python`,
           provides a tool that is extensible, powerful and freely available. A
           significant advantage to :term:`Python` is the existing suite of tools for
           array calculations, sparse matrices and data rendering. 
        
           The :term:`FiPy` framework includes terms for transient diffusion,
           convection and standard sources, enabling the solution of arbitrary
           combinations of coupled elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs. Currently
           implemented models include phase field
           [BoettingerReview:2002]_ [ChenReview:2002]_ [McFaddenReview:2002]_ treatments of
           polycrystalline, dendritic, and electrochemical phase transformations as
           well as a level set treatment of the electrodeposition process
           [NIST:damascene:2001]_.

        ---------------------------------
        Even if you don't read manuals...
        ---------------------------------
        
        ...please read the :ref:`INSTALLATION`, :ref:`USAGE` and :ref:`FAQ`
        documents.
        
        --------------------------------
        What's new in version |release|?
        --------------------------------
        
        The bump in major version number reflects more on the substantial increase
        in capabilities and ease of use than it does on a break in compatibility
        with FiPy 2.x. Few, if any, changes to your existing scripts should be
        necessary.
        
        The significant changes since version 2.1 are:
        
        - Tests can now be run on a full install using `fipy.test()`.
        - Grid classes now take an `Lx` argument. 
        - The functions of the :mod:`~fipy.tools.numerix` module are no longer 
          included in the :mod:`fipy` namespace. See :mod:`examples.updating.update2_0to3_0` 
          for details.
        - Support for Python 3. Please see :ref:`RunningUnderPython3` for details.
        
        Tickets fixed in this release::
        
            171	update the mayavi viewer to use  mayavi 2
            286	'matplotlib: list index out of range' when no title given, but only sometimes
            197	~binOp doesn't work on branches/version-2_0
            194	`easy_install` instructions for MacOSX are broken
            192	broken setuptools url with python 2.6
            184	The FiPy webpage seems to be broken on Internet Explorer
            168	Switch documentation to use `:math:` directive
            198	FiPy2.0.2 LinearJORSolver.__init__  calls Solver rather than PysparseSolver
            199	`gmshExport.exportAsMesh()` doesn't work
            195	broken arithmetic face to cell distance calculations
        
        .. warning::
        
           :term:`FiPy` 3 brought unavoidable syntax changes from :term:`FiPy` 2.
           Please see :mod:`examples.updating.update2_0to3_0` for guidance on the
           changes that you will need to make to your :term:`FiPy` 2.x scripts.

        Please refer to :ref:`INSTALLATION` for details on download and
        installation. :term:`FiPy` can be redistributed and/or modified
        freely, provided that any derivative works bear some notice that they
        are derived from it, and any modified versions bear some notice that
        they have been modified.

        You can communicate with the :term:`FiPy` developers and with other
        users via our `mailing list`_ and we welcome you to use the `tracking
        system`_ for bugs, support requests, feature requests and patch
        submissions <http://matforge.org/fipy/report>. We welcome
        collaborative efforts on this project.
        
        :term:`FiPy` is a member of MatForge_, a project of the `Materials
        Digital Library Pathway`_. This National Science Foundation funded
        service provides management of our public source code repository, our
        bug tracking system, and a "wiki" space for public contributions of
        code snippets, discussions, and tutorials.

        ------------------------
        Conventions and Notation
        ------------------------
        
        :term:`FiPy` is driven by :term:`Python` script files than you can view or modify in any
        text editor.  :term:`FiPy` sessions are invoked from a command-line shell, such
        as :command:`tcsh` or :command:`bash`.
        
        Throughout, text to be typed at the keyboard will appear ``like this``.
        Commands to be issued from an interactive shell will appear::
        
            $ like this
        
        where you would enter the text ("``like this``") following the shell prompt,
        denoted by "``$``".
        
        Text blocks of the form::
        
            >>> a = 3 * 4
            >>> a
            12
            >>> if a == 12:
            ...     print "a is twelve"
            ...
            a is twelve
        
        are intended to indicate an interactive session in the :term:`Python` interpreter.
        We will refer to these as "interactive sessions" or as "doctest blocks".
        The text "``>>>``" at the beginning of a line denotes the *primary prompt*,
        calling for input of a :term:`Python` command.  The text "``...``" denotes the
        *secondary prompt*, which calls for input that continues from the line
        above, when required by :term:`Python` syntax.  All remaining lines, which begin
        at the left margin, denote output from the :term:`Python` interpreter.  In all
        cases, the prompt is supplied by the :term:`Python` interpreter and should not be
        typed by you.
        
        .. warning::
        
           :term:`Python` is sensitive to indentation and care should be taken to enter
           text exactly as it appears in the examples.
        
        When references are made to file system paths, it is assumed that the
        current working directory is the :term:`FiPy` distribution directory, refered to
        as the "base directory", such that::
        
            examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D.py
        
        will correspond to, *e.g.*::
        
            /some/where/FiPy-X.Y/examples/diffusion/steadyState/mesh1D.py
        
        Paths will always be rendered using POSIX conventions (path elements
        separated by "``/``").  Any references of the form::
        
            examples.diffusion.steadyState.mesh1D
        
        are in the :term:`Python` module notation and correspond to the equivalent POSIX
        path given above.
        
        We may at times use a 
        
        .. note::
        
           to indicate something that may be of interest
        
        or a
        
        .. warning::
        
           to indicate something that could cause serious problems.

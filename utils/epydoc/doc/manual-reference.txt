Command Line Usage
------------------

Usage: ``epydoc.py`` [*ACTION*] [*options*] *NAMES...*

NAMES...
    A list of the Python objects that should be documented. Objects can be
    specified using dotted names (such as ``os.path``), module filenames (such
    as ``epydoc/epytext.py``), or package directory names (such as
    ``epydoc/``). Packages are expanded to include all sub-modules and
    sub-packages.

  API Linking Options:
    --external-api=NAME
                        Define a new API document.  A new interpreted text
                        role NAME will be added.

                        output.  Graphs are generated using the Graphviz dot
                        executable.  If this executable is not on the path,
                        then use --dotpath to specify its location.  This
                        option may be repeated to include multiple graph types
                        in the output.  GRAPHTYPE should be one of: all,
                        classtree, callgraph, umlclasstree.

    --graph-font-size=SIZE
                        Specify the font size used to generate Graphviz
                        graphs, in points.
    --pstat=FILE        A pstat output file, to be used in generating call
                        graphs.

  Return Value Options:
    --fail-on-error     Return a non-zero exit status, indicating failure, if
                        any errors are encountered.
    --fail-on-warning   Return a non-zero exit status, indicating failure, if
                        any errors or warnings are encountered (not including
                        docstring warnings).
    --fail-on-docstring-warning
                        Return a non-zero exit status, indicating failure, if
                        any errors or warnings are encountered (including
                        docstring warnings).


Sample Configuration File
-------------------------

Configuration files, specified using the ``--config`` option, may be used to
specify both the list of objects to document, and the options that should be
used to document them. Configuration files are read using the standard
ConfigParser_ module. The following example configuration file demonstrates the
various options that you can set. Lines beginning with ``#`` or ``;`` are
treated as comments.

Warnings and Errors
-------------------

If epydoc encounters an error while processing a docstring, it issues a warning
message that describes the error, and attempts to continue generating
documentation. Errors related to epytext are divided into three categories:

Epytext Warnings
    are caused by epytext docstrings that contain questionable or suspicious
    markup. Epytext warnings do not prevent the docstring in question from
    being parsed.

Field Warnings
    are caused by epytext docstrings containing invalid fields. The contents of
    the invalid field are generally ignored.

Epytext Errors
    are caused by epytext docstrings that contain invalid markup. Whenever an
    epytext error is detected, the docstring in question is treated as a
    plaintext docstring.

The following sections list and describe the warning messages that epydoc can
generate. They are intended as a reference resource, which you can search for
more information and possible causes if you encounter an error and do not
understand it. These descriptions are also available in the ``epydoc(1)`` man
page.


Epytext Warnings
''''''''''''''''

Possible mal-formatted field item.
    Epytext detected a line that looks like a field item, but is not correctly
    formatted. This typically occurs when the trailing colon (``:``) is not
    included in the field tag.

Possible heading typo.
    Epytext detected a pair of lines that looks like a heading, but the number
    of underline characters does not match the number of characters in the
    heading. The number of characters in these two lines must match exactly for
    them to be considered a heading.


Field Warnings
''''''''''''''

``@param`` for unknown parameter *param*.
    A ``@param`` field was used to specify the type for a parameter that is not
    included in the function's signature. This is typically caused by a typo in
    the parameter name.

*tag* did not expect an argument.
    The field tag *tag* was used with an argument, but it does not take one.

*tag* expected an argument.
    The field tag *tag* was used without an argument, but it requires one.

``@type`` for unknown parameter *param*.
    A ``@type`` field was used to specify the type for a parameter that is not
    included in the function's signature. This is typically caused by a typo in
    the parameter name.

``@type`` for unknown variable *var*.
    A ``@type`` field was used to specify the type for a variable, but no
    other information is known about the variable. This is typically caused
    by a typo in the variable name.

Unknown field tag *tag*.
    A docstring contains a field with the unknown tag *tag*.

Redefinition of *field*.
    Multiple field tags define the value of field in the same docstring, but
    field can only take a single value.


Epytext Errors
''''''''''''''

Bad link target.
    The target specified for an inline link contruction (L{...}) is not
    well-formed. Link targets must be valid Python identifiers.

Bad uri target.
    The target specified for an inline uri contruction (``U{...}``) is not
    well-formed. This typically occurs if inline markup is nested inside the
    URI target.

Fields must be at the top level.
    The list of fields (``@param``, etc.) is contained by some other block
    structure (such as a list or a section).

Fields must be the final elements in an epytext string.
    The list of fields (``@param``, etc.) is not at the end of a docstring.

Headings must occur at top level.
    The heading is contianed in some other block structure (such as a list).

Improper doctest block indentation.
    The doctest block dedents past the indentation of its initial prompt line.

Improper heading indentation.
    The heading for a section is not left-aligned with the paragraphs in the
    section that contains it.

Improper paragraph indentation.
    The paragraphs within a block are not left-aligned. This error is often
    generated when plaintext docstrings are parsed using epytext.

Invalid escape.
    An unknown escape sequence was used with the inline escape construction
    (``E{...}``).

Lists must be indented.
    An unindented line immediately following a paragraph starts with a list
    bullet. Epydoc is not sure whether you meant to start a new list item, or
    meant for a paragraph to include a word that looks like a bullet. If you
    intended the former, then indent the list. If you intended the latter, then
    change the word-wrapping of the paragraph, or escape the first character of
    the word that looks like a bullet.

Unbalanced '``{``'.
    The docstring contains unbalanced braces. Epytext requires that all braces
    must be balanced. To include a single unbalanced brace, use the escape
    sequences ``E{lb}`` (left brace) and ``E{rb}`` (right brace).
    
Unbalanced '``}``'.
    The docstring contains unbalanced braces. Epytext requires that all braces
    must be balanced. To include a single unbalanced brace, use the escape
    sequences ``E{lb}`` (left brace) and ``E{rb}`` (right brace).

Unknown inline markup tag.
      An unknown tag was used with the inline markup construction (``x{...}``).

Wrong underline character for heading.
    The underline character used for this section heading does not indicate an
    appopriate section level. The '``=``' character should be used to underline
    sections; '``-``' for subsections; and '``~``' for subsubsections.

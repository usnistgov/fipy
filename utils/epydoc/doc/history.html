<h1> Epydoc History </h1>

<p> I originally became interested in automatic API documentation
extraction tools for Python in March 2002.  At the time, there were
several such tools available, including <a
href="http://web.lfw.org/python/pydoc.html">pydoc</a> and <a
href="http://happydoc.sourceforge.net/">HappyDoc</a>.  However, none
were widely used.  I joined the <a
href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/doc-sig/">doc-sig mailing
list</a>, and started working with its members on creating standards
for API documentation tools in Python. </p>

<p> I created epydoc as a tool for exploring the issues involved in
writing an automatic API documentation extraction tool.  I also
decided to use epydoc to document the <a
href="http://nltk.sourceforge.net/">Natural Language Toolkit</a>, so
that I would have a fairly large project with which to test out my
system.  The markup language and the output of epydoc have changed
many times, and epydoc itself has undergone at least 3 complete
rewrites.  But eventually epydoc matured into a more stable
system. </p>

<p> Over the past year, I haven't had much time to participate in the
discussion of API documentation tool standards on the doc-sig mailing
list.  However, I've been adding features to epydoc as I need them for
the Natural Language Toolkit.  If there are any features that you're
interested in seeing added to epydoc, please let me know. </p>

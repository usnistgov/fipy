LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
FiPy is an object oriented, partial differential equation (PDE) solver,
written in Python, based on a standard finite volume (FV) approach.  This
combination provides a tool that is extensible, powerful and freely
available.  A significant advantage to Python is the existing suite of
tools for array calculations, sparse matrices and data rendering.

The FiPy framework includes terms for transient diffusion, convection and
standard sources, enabling the solution of arbitrary combinations of
coupled elliptic, hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs.  Currently implemented
models include phase field treatments of polycrystalline, dendritic, and
electrochemical phase transformations, as well as drug eluting stents,
reactive wetting, photovoltaics and a level set treatment of the
electrodeposition process.

        Build and save any information relevant to the construction of a grid.
        Generalized to handle any dimension. Has side-effects.

        Dimension specific functionality is built into `_buildOverlap` and
        `_packOffset`, which are overridden by children of this class. Often,
        this method is overridden (but always called) by children classes who
        must distinguish between uniform and non-uniform behavior.

        :Note:
            - `spatialNums` is a list whose elements are analogous to
                * numberOfHorizontalRows
                * numberOfVerticalColumns
                * numberOfLayersDeep
              though `spatialNums` may be of length 1, 2, or 3 depending on
              dimensionality.

class TransientTerm(CellTerm):
    r"""
    The `TransientTerm` represents

    .. math::

       \int_V \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} dV \simeq
       \frac{(\rho_{P} \phi_{P} - \rho_{P}^\text{old} \phi_P^\text{old}) V_P}{\Delta t}

    where :math:`\rho` is the `coeff` value.

    The following test case verifies that variable coefficients and
    old coefficient values work correctly. We will solve the
    following equation

    .. math::

       \frac{ \partial \phi^2 } { \partial t } = k.

    The analytic solution is given by

    .. math::

       \phi = \sqrt{ \phi_0^2 + k t },

    where :math:`\phi_0` is the initial value.

    >>> phi0 = 1.
    >>> k = 1.
    >>> dt = 1.
    >>> relaxationFactor = 1.5
    >>> steps = 2
    >>> sweeps = 8

    >>> from fipy.meshes import Grid1D
    >>> mesh = Grid1D(nx = 1)
    >>> from fipy.variables.cellVariable import CellVariable
    >>> var = CellVariable(mesh = mesh, value = phi0, hasOld = 1)
    >>> from fipy.terms.transientTerm import TransientTerm
    >>> from fipy.terms.implicitSourceTerm import ImplicitSourceTerm

    Relaxation, given by `relaxationFactor`, is required for a
    converged solution.

    >>> eq = TransientTerm(var) == ImplicitSourceTerm(-relaxationFactor) \
    ...                            + var * relaxationFactor + k

    A number of sweeps at each time step are required to let the
    relaxation take effect.

    >>> for step in range(steps):
    ...     var.updateOld()
    ...     for sweep in range(sweeps):
    ...         eq.solve(var, dt = dt)

    Compare the final result with the analytical solution.

    >>> print var.allclose(numerix.sqrt(k * dt * steps + phi0**2))

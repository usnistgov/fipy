"""
The iterative solvers may output warnings if the solution is considered
unsatisfactory. If you are not interested in these warnings, you can invoke
python with a warning filter such as::

    $ python -Wignore::fipy.SolverConvergenceWarning myscript.py

If you are extremely concerned about your preconditioner for some reason, you
can abort whenever it has problems with::
